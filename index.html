                     Cosme Chavez is an independent software developer with over 4 years of experience based in San Diego, California.

                    He migrated from Mexico in 2013 and developed a passion for computers at an early age.
                    His passion lead him to teach himself, and pratice his skills. His motivation came from his passion
                    and curiosity that eventually lead into a career. He saw the world of computing and engineering differently; 
                    he did not see it as a job. Computing was more than that: it was his art, it was his will.

                <div class="paragraph">
                    He saw his ability to create software as a method of expression, an escape, but especially, a method to 
                    create something unique. He takes pride in his work, he believes his effort has to be meaningful, regardless
                    of how small or big his operation is.
