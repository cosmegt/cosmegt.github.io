                     Cosme Chavez. I am an independent software developer with over 4 years of experience based in San Diego, California.
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    I migrated from Xalapa, Ver, Mexico in 2013. This transition allowed me to prove myself. A 3-year long transition that let
                    me think about my passions and the things that matter in my life, my present and future life. 
                    I developed a passion for computers at an early age from looking at my step-father work with computers.
                    My passion lead me to teach myself, and pratice my skills. My motivation came from my passion
                    and curiosity that eventually lead into my career. I saw the world of computing and engineering differently; 
                    I did not see it as a job. Computing was more than that: it was my art, it was my will, a part of my soul.
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    I saw my ability to create software as a method of expression, an escape, but especially, a method to 
                    create something unique. I take pride my my work, I believe that my effort has to be meaningful, regardless
                    of how small or big my operation is.
