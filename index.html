                    My name is Cosme Chavez. I am an independent software developer with over 4 years of experience, based in San Diego, California.

                    I migrated from Xalapa, Ver, Mexico in 2013. When I moved to America, I saw a pinnacle of opportunity. A one-year long transition that let
                    me think about my passions and the things that matter in my present and future life.
                    I couldn't see myself working a mindless job from 9:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. That idea made me feel sick; I wanted to do something,
                    build something, create something. I was so ambitious, I couldn't sleep, drink or eat. I entered a drepression from not knowing
                    what my life was about. I had to do something about it. It took me nights, days, weeks and months to find my identity, for what I
                    wanted to be. I filled my life with art, philosophy, music and other disiplines, to help me cope with that emptiness. I kept searching for a
                    conclusion to my conundrum, but found myself hopeless, until I touched programming. Then I had realized; this is my life.
                    I knew I had developed an interest for computers at an early age from looking at my step-father work with computers, watching him struggle throught a problem
                    facinated me, I was maybe nine or ten years old, yet I knew, that the stuff fasinated me, I just did not know how much.
                    I digged into the subject, and so little did I know, I had so much left to learn (I still do.) Not just programming, but I progressed my own path into computing
                    and computer science. I learned about networking, cyber-security, software development, I learned languages, technologies, anything I could, and I practiced
                    like a maniac. Not because I thought it would make me lots of money, rather the pure persuit of knowledge, to fulthfill my human nature, my curiousity, my passion.
                    This passion lead me to teach myself, and pratice my skills that eventually lead into my career. I saw the world of computing and engineering differently; 
                    I did not see it as a job. Computing was more than that: it was my art, it was my will, a part of my soul.

                <div class="paragraph">
                    I saw my ability to create software as a method of expression, an escape, but especially, a method to 
                    create something unique. I take pride of my work, I believe that my effort has to be meaningful, regardless
                    of how small or big my operation is. I have to make something that signes my signature, otherwise it is not worth it.
